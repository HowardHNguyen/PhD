This project is for my PhD dissertation proposal, my disseration subject is Heart Failure Early Detection and Prediction by Traditional MLs and Neural Network-Based Models vs. Stacking Models, re-submitted on August of 2024.
This directory includes all Python codes of MLs, neural network-based models, and Stacking models implemention on 7 different datasets from 303 to 319,795 records.
For the Web application, please go to the directory of /cvd, /cvd_transformer, or /cvd_stack for its source codes.
Thanks.
